# 14 | Longest Collatz sequence
# https://projecteuler.net/problem=14
# 
# The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
#   
# n → n/2 (n is even)
# n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
# 
# Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
#   
# 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
# It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) 
# contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), 
# it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
# 
# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
# 
# NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
